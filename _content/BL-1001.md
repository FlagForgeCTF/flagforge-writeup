## Understanding HTTP Request Methods

1. GET

The GET method is used to retrieve information from a server. It is the most common method used for fetching web pages. Since GET requests are meant to retrieve data, they should not modify the server's state.

```bash
curl -X GET http://example.com
```

2. POST

The POST method is used to send data to a server, usually to create or update a resource. Unlike GET, POST requests include a body containing the data being sent.

```bash
curl -X POST -d "username=admin&password=pass" http://example.com/login
```

3. PUT

The PUT method is used to update an existing resource or create a new one if it does not exist.

```bash
curl -X PUT -d '{"name":"John"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://example.com/user/1
```

4. HEAD

The HEAD method is similar to GET, but it only retrieves the headers, not the actual content. This is useful for checking if a resource exists or obtaining metadata.

```bash
curl -I http://example.com
```

5. DELETE

The DELETE method removes a specified resource from the server.

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://example.com/resource/1
```

## GetHEAD Challenge Writeup

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, users need to retrieve a specific flag from the server by sending an HTTP HEAD request. The goal is to understand how to extract metadata without fetching the entire page content.

## Steps to Solve the Challenge

1. Identify the Target URL: The challenge may provide a URL where the flag is located.

2. Send a HEAD Request: Use curl or a similar tool to send a HEAD request to the server.

Example:
```bash
curl -I http://challenge.com
```
This will return only the HTTP headers.

3. Look for the Flag in the Headers: The response headers may contain the flag, often in a custom header such as X-Flag.

Example Response:
```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2025 10:00:00 GMT
Server: Apache
X-Flag: FLAG{HEAD_REQUEST_SUCCESS}
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```
4. Submit the Flag: Extract the flag from the X-Flag header and submit it to complete the challenge.

## Alternative Approaches

- Use Python with requests:
```python
import requests
response = requests.head("http://challenge.com")
print(response.headers)
```
Use Burp Suite to intercept the request and modify the method to HEAD.

- Use Postman or Burpsuite to change http method request.

## Conclusion

Understanding HTTP request methods, especially HEAD, is essential for web security testing and API interactions. This challenge helps reinforce the importance of metadata retrieval and efficient server communication without unnecessary data transfer.
