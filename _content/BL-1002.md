## Scavenger Hunt Challenge Writeup

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, users must find the hidden flag by exploring different web files such as `index.html`, `index.css`, `index.js`, and `robots.txt`. Each step provides a hint leading to the next clue until the final flag is discovered.

## Steps to Solve the Challenge

### Step 1: Explore `index.html`

The main HTML file (`index.html`) contain 1st part of flag.

CSS files sometimes contain comments that highlight 2nd part of flag.

### Step 3: Dig into `myjs.js`

JavaScript files may contain hint. "How can I keep Google from indexing my website?" Google it.

### Step 4: Investigate `robots.txt`

The `robots.txt` file often contains directories or files that are disallowed for search engines but might be useful for discovery.

Here 'robots.txt' carry 3rd part of flag and hint for next flag.

## Alternative Approaches

- Use browser Developer Tools (Inspect Element, Console, Network tab) to explore web files.
- Use `grep` or similar commands to search for clues in downloaded files:
  ```bash
  grep -r "FLAG" .
  ```
- Use online tools to decode any encoded text.

## Conclusion

This scavenger hunt challenge teaches the importance of analyzing various web files for security testing and CTF competitions. Understanding where information can be hidden is crucial for ethical hacking and penetration testing.
