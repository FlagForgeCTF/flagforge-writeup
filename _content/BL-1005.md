## What is DAD Triad {#What-is-a-DAD-Triad}
![DAD](/BL-1004/DAD.png)
 The DAD Triad is a model used in cybersecurity to understand the risks that could hurt a system’s security. Unlike the CIA Triad, which focuses on positive security aspects, the DAD Triad focuses on the dangers we need to protect against. The DAD Triad stands for Disclosure, Alteration, and Denial.

### Disclosure {#Disclosure}
- Prevents unauthorized release of information
- Protects sensitive data from being exposed
- Prevented by encrypting and restricting access

Disclosure happens when private information is released to the wrong people. For example, if a hacker steals your password or private messages, that’s a breach of confidentiality. We protect against disclosure by encrypting sensitive data and limiting who can access it. This ensures only the right people can see important information.

### Alteration {#Alteration}
- Prevents changes to data without permission
- Ensures data stays accurate and trusted
- Prevented by using checks like encryption and hashing

Alteration is when someone changes data without permission. Imagine if someone changed your online banking balance. To prevent this, we use tools like encryption (which keeps data secret) and hashing (which checks if data has been tampered with). These checks help make sure the data is accurate and hasn’t been changed by someone who shouldn’t have.

### Denial {#Denial}
- Prevents people from losing access to systems or data
- Ensures resources are available when needed
- Prevented by backups and recovery plans

Denial happens when authorized users can’t access systems or services. For example, if a website is down and customers can’t buy anything, that’s a denial of service. To avoid this, systems are built with backups and failover systems. These are like spare parts that keep everything running smoothly, even if something goes wrong.

## Explaining the DAD Triad with an example
![dad-counters](/BL-1004/dad-cia.png)
Let’s say you’re shopping online:
![example](/BL-1004/example.png)
- <b>Disclosure</b>: If the online store’s database gets hacked and your personal details are exposed, that’s disclosure. The store uses encryption to protect your information so only they can see it.

- <b>Alteration</b>: If someone changes the price of products on the website, that’s alteration. The store uses checks to make sure no one can change prices or orders without permission.

- <b>Denial</b>: If the website is attacked and goes down, preventing you from shopping, that’s denial. The store uses backups and recovery plans to keep the site up and running.

So, the DAD Triad helps the store protect your information from being exposed, changed, or taken away when you need it.

## Conclusion {#Conclusion}
The DAD Triad helps us think about the bad things that can happen to a system. By understanding Disclosure, Alteration, and Denial, we can put in place measures to keep systems safe. These are all risks that need to be prevented to make sure our systems stay secure and reliable.
