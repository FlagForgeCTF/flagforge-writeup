## What is CIA Triad {#What-is-CIA-Triad}

Before determining if a system is secure, it's important to understand the key components of security. To assess the security of a system, we often refer to the security triad: confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).

### Confidentiality {#Confidentiality}

- Prevents disclosure of communication between sender and receiver (data in motion) or of stored data (data at rest)
- Properly label and store sensitive information
- Some data should be encrypted based on it’s sensitivity or use

Confidentiality focuses on controlling access to data, including two key areas:
- <b>Data in motion</b> refers to information being transmitted, like emails or uploads, which must be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access. 
- <b>Data at rest</b> refers to stored data, such as on hard drives or USB drives, and must be secured to avoid unauthorized access, especially if devices are lost or stolen. 

Proper labeling and storage practices are essential, with access restricted based on the data's sensitivity, as seen in categories like Top Secret or Unclassified in the military.

### Integrity {#Integrity}
- Ensures the accuracy and consistency of information during all processing, transmission and storage to avoid changes.
- Using Encryption, Auditing, Hashing and Digital Signatures.

When we talk about data integrity, it means making sure that no one can change our information without permission. This is important no matter what we're doing with the data—whether we’re working with it, sending it, or storing it. 

To protect the data, we can use encryption, which turns it into a secret code so only authorized people can read it. Another tool is hashing, which gives the data a unique "fingerprint" to spot if it’s been altered. We can also set up checks to catch anyone trying to access the data without permission and use digital signatures on important documents to confirm they’re real and haven’t been tampered with. It’s all about keeping the data safe and unaltered.

### Availability {#Availability}
- Those who are authorized to access resources can do so in a reliable and timely manner — Is it up?
- Fund Systems for Redundancy, Virtualization, Cloud Computing, Incident Response Plans, Disaster Recovery

In terms of Availability, we ensure our systems are always accessible by preparing for issues like hardware failures or power outages. We use backups, like extra internet connections, to prevent disruptions.

Virtualization helps by providing duplicate systems that can take over if something breaks. Cloud services also ensure resources are always available. We have incident response plans to handle problems quickly and disaster recovery plans to keep things running if major events, like fires, happen-ensuring users can always access services without interruption.

## Explaining the CIA Triad with an example {#Explaining-the-CIA-Triad-with-an-example}

Let’s say you’re using an online banking app to check your balance or transfer money. The app has to be secure, and that’s where the CIA Triad comes in—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

- Confidentiality: This is about making sure only the right people can see your personal information. When you log in, your data, like your bank account details, is encrypted. It’s like putting your information in a secret code so that no one else can read it, even if they try to access it.

- Integrity: This means ensuring that the data you see in the app is accurate and hasn’t been changed. If you make a transfer, the system checks to make sure no one has tampered with it. So, you can trust that your transaction is exactly what you intended, and your account balance is correct.

- Availability: This is all about making sure you can access the app whenever you need it. If the bank’s servers go down, they have backup systems in place so the app stays up and running. This way, you’re not locked out of your account when you need it most.

So, the CIA Triad makes sure your information is kept private (Confidentiality), stays accurate (Integrity), and is always available (Availability) when you need it.

## Conclusion {#Conclusion}
In conclusion, understanding and implementing the principles of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) form the foundational pillars of cybersecurity. Safeguarding sensitive information, preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring data remains unchanged are crucial elements in maintaining the security and reliability of our systems.
