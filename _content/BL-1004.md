Security is a term that gets used a lot, with companies quick to claim their products or services are secure. But how secure are they really?

Before we dive into security principles, it's important to understand potential threats. Are you just trying to keep a curious toddler from messing with your laptop, or are you defending sensitive technical designs worth millions from corporate spies? Treating both threats the same would be ridiculous. That’s why identifying the adversary is key—it helps us understand their tactics and apply the right security measures.

## What is CIA Triad {#What-is-CIA-Triad}
![CIA](/BL-1004/cia.png)

Before determining if a system is secure, it's important to understand the key components of security. To assess the security of a system, we often refer to the security triad: confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).

### Confidentiality {#Confidentiality}

- Prevents disclosure of communication between sender and receiver (data in motion) or of stored data (data at rest)
- Properly label and store sensitive information
- Some data should be encrypted based on it’s sensitivity or use

Confidentiality focuses on controlling access to data, including two key areas:
- <b>Data in motion</b> refers to information being transmitted (e.g, on emails, uploads) that must be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access. 
- <b>Data at rest</b> refers to stored data (e.g, on hard drives, USBs), that must be secured to avoid unauthorized access, especially if devices are lost or stolen. 

Proper labeling and storage practices are essential, with access restricted based on the data sensitivity, similar to military categories like Top Secret or Unclassified.
### Integrity {#Integrity}
- Ensures the accuracy and consistency of information during all processing, transmission and storage to avoid changes.
- Using Encryption, Auditing, Hashing and Digital Signatures.

When we talk about data integrity, it means making sure that no one can change our information without permission. This is important no matter what we're doing with the data—whether we’re working with it, sending it, or storing it. 

To protect the data, we can use encryption, which turns it into a secret code so only authorized people can read it. Another tool is hashing, which gives the data a unique "fingerprint" to spot if it’s been altered. We can also set up checks to catch anyone trying to access the data without permission and use digital signatures on important documents to confirm they’re real and haven’t been tampered with. It’s all about keeping the data safe and unaltered.

### Availability {#Availability}
- Those who are authorized to access resources can do so in a reliable and timely manner — Is it up?
- Fund Systems for Redundancy, Virtualization, Cloud Computing, Incident Response Plans, Disaster Recovery

In terms of Availability, we ensure our systems are always accessible by preparing for issues like hardware failures or power outages. We use backups, like extra internet connections, to prevent disruptions.

Virtualization helps by providing duplicate systems that can take over if something breaks. Cloud services also ensure resources are always available. We have incident response plans to handle problems quickly and disaster recovery plans to keep things running if major events, like fires, happen-ensuring users can always access services without interruption.

### Explaining the CIA Triad with an example {#Explaining-the-CIA-Triad-with-an-example}

Let's say you're using an online banking app to check your balance or transfer money. The app has to be secure, and that’s where the CIA Triad comes in—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

![CIA](/BL-1004/example.png)

- Confidentiality: This is about making sure only the right people can see your personal information. When you log in, your data, like your bank account details, is encrypted. It’s like putting your information in a secret code so that no one else can read it, even if they try to access it.

- Integrity: This means ensuring that the data you see in the app is accurate and hasn’t been changed. If you make a transfer, the system checks to make sure no one has tampered with it. So, you can trust that your transaction is exactly what you intended, and your account balance is correct.

- Availability: This is all about making sure you can access the app whenever you need it. If the bank’s servers go down, they have backup systems in place so the app stays up and running. This way, you’re not locked out of your account when you need it most.

So, the CIA Triad makes sure your information is kept private (Confidentiality), stays accurate (Integrity), and is always available (Availability) when you need it. 

![DAD-Header](/BL-1004/dad-header.png)

## What is DAD Triad {#What-is-DAD-Triad}
![DAD](/BL-1004/DAD.png)
 The DAD Triad is a model used in cybersecurity to understand the risks that could hurt a system’s security. Unlike the CIA Triad, which focuses on positive security aspects, the DAD Triad focuses on the dangers we need to protect against. The DAD Triad stands for Disclosure, Alteration, and Denial.

### Disclosure {#Disclosure}
- Prevents unauthorized release of information
- Protects sensitive data from being exposed
- Prevented by encrypting and restricting access

Disclosure happens when private information is released to the wrong people. For example, if a hacker steals your password or private messages, that’s a breach of confidentiality. We protect against disclosure by encrypting sensitive data and limiting who can access it. This ensures only the right people can see important information.

### Alteration {#Alteration}
- Prevents changes to data without permission
- Ensures data stays accurate and trusted
- Prevented by using checks like encryption and hashing

Alteration is when someone changes data without permission. Imagine if someone changed your online banking balance. To prevent this, we use tools like encryption (which keeps data secret) and hashing (which checks if data has been tampered with). These checks help make sure the data is accurate and hasn’t been changed by someone who shouldn’t have.

### Denial {#Denial}
- Prevents people from losing access to systems or data
- Ensures resources are available when needed
- Prevented by backups and recovery plans

Denial happens when authorized users can’t access systems or services. For example, if a website is down and customers can’t buy anything, that’s a denial of service. To avoid this, systems are built with backups and failover systems. These are like spare parts that keep everything running smoothly, even if something goes wrong.

### Explaining the DAD Triad with an example  {#Explaining-the-DAD-Triad-with-an-example}
![dad-counters](/BL-1004/dad-cia.png)
Let’s say you’re shopping online:
![example](/BL-1004/example.png)
- <b>Disclosure</b>: If the online store’s database gets hacked and your personal details are exposed, that’s disclosure. The store uses encryption to protect your information so only they can see it.

- <b>Alteration</b>: If someone changes the price of products on the website, that’s alteration. The store uses checks to make sure no one can change prices or orders without permission.

- <b>Denial</b>: If the website is attacked and goes down, preventing you from shopping, that’s denial. The store uses backups and recovery plans to keep the site up and running.

So, the DAD Triad helps the store protect your information from being exposed, changed, or taken away when you need it.

## What are Security Models? {#What-are-Security-Models}

A security model is a set of rules and policies that help keep systems and data safe. These models define how information should be accessed, who can modify it, and how to prevent security risks. Different models are used in different situations, depending on the level of security required.
## Common Security Models   
#### Bell-LaPadula Model (BLP) {#Bell-LaPadula-Model-BLP}
- Focuses on confidentiality (keeping secrets safe)
- Prevents unauthorized access to classified information
- Used in government and military systems

The Bell-LaPadula Model is all about keeping sensitive data secure. It follows two main rules:

- <b>No Read Up (Simple Security Property):</b> A lower-level user (e.g., a regular employee) cannot read higher-level data (e.g., Top Secret documents).
- <b>No Write Down (Star Property):</b> A higher-level user (e.g., a manager) cannot write data to a lower security level to prevent leaks.

<b>Example</b>: Imagine a government database where only authorized personnel can view top-secret files. Regular employees can’t see them, and even high-ranking officers can’t move them to a lower-security area. 

#### Biba Model {#Biba-Model}

- Focuses on integrity (keeping data accurate and unchanged)
- Prevents unauthorized modification of information
- Used in financial and medical systems

The Biba Model ensures that data remains correct and is not changed by unauthorized users. It has opposite rules to Bell-LaPadula:
- <b>No Read Down:</b> A higher-level user cannot read lower-level (untrusted) data.
- <b>No Write Up:</b> A lower-level user cannot modify higher-level data.

<b>Example:</b> In a hospital, a doctor can update patient records, but a receptionist cannot. This prevents unauthorized changes to medical data.

#### Clark-Wilson Model {#Clark-Wilson-Model}
- Focuses on integrity and access control
- Uses well-defined rules for who can access and modify data
- Used in banking and transaction-based systems

The Clark-Wilson Model ensures that only authorized users can modify important data. It uses:
- <b>Well-formed transactions:</b> Data can only be changed using specific, controlled actions.
- <b>Separation of duties:</b> One person cannot perform every step of a process, reducing fraud risk.

<b>Example:</b> In an online banking system, a customer can request a money transfer, but only a bank employee can approve and process it.

#### Brewer-Nash Model (Chinese Wall Model) {#Brewer-Nash-Model-Chinese-Wall-Model}
- Prevents conflicts of interest
- Ensures that users cannot access conflicting sets of information
- Used in businesses, financial firms, and law offices

The Brewer-Nash Model is designed to prevent someone from accessing sensitive information from competing companies.

<b>Example:</b> A financial consultant working with Company A cannot access data from Company B if they are competitors. This prevents inside trading and conflicts of interest.

#### Mandatory Access Control (MAC) vs. Discretionary Access Control (DAC) {#Mandatory-Access-Control-MAC-vs.-Discretionary-Access-Control-DAC}
- <b>MAC:</b> The system decides who can access data (used in military and government security).
- <b>DAC:</b> The data owner decides who can access it (used in businesses and personal computers).

<b>Example:</b> In a MAC system, only the administrator can assign access levels. In a DAC system, a file owner can choose who can read or edit their files. 

## What is Defense in Depth {#What-is-Defense-in-Depth}
Defense in Depth is a security strategy that uses multiple layers of protection to keep systems safe. Instead of relying on just one security measure, it combines several security controls so that if one fails, others are still in place to stop an attack.

Think of it like a castle:

- A castle has walls, guards, moats, and locked doors to protect against intruders.
- If an attacker gets past one layer (like the moat), they still have to get past the walls, guards, and locked doors.
- This makes it much harder for them to succeed.

In cybersecurity, we apply the same concept by using multiple layers of security controls.

### Why is Defense in Depth Important {#Why-is-Defense-in-Depth-Important}

No security measure is 100% foolproof. Hackers can find ways to bypass firewalls, antivirus, or passwords. But if multiple security layers are in place, breaking into a system becomes much harder.

### Key benefits:{#Key-benefits}
- <b>Reduces risk</b> – If one layer fails, another one is there to stop the attack.
- <b>Slows down attackers</b> – More security barriers mean more time and effort for hackers.
- <b>Increases protection</b> – Multiple defenses protect against different types of threats.

### Layers of Defense in Depth {#Layers-of-Defense-in-Depth}
1. <b>Physical Security</b>
- Protects the physical devices that store data.
- Examples: Security guards, locked doors, CCTV cameras, biometric access (fingerprints, keycards).

<b>Example:</b> A hacker cannot access a company’s server if it is locked in a secure room with fingerprint access.

2. <b>Network Security</b>
- Protects data as it moves through the network.
- Examples: Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

3. <b>Endpoint Security</b>
- Protects devices like computers, phones, and tablets.
- Examples: Antivirus software, patch updates, disabling USB access.

Example: An employee’s laptop has antivirus software that stops malware from infecting it.

4. <b>Application Security</b>
- Protects software and applications from being hacked.
- Examples: Secure coding practices, regular updates, input validation, authentication systems (MFA).

Example: A banking app requires Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) before allowing a transaction.

5. <b>Data Security</b>
- Protects stored or transmitted data from being stolen or altered.
- Examples: Encryption, backups, access control policies.

Example: A company encrypts its customer data so that even if hackers steal it, they can’t read it without the encryption key.

6. <b>Human Layer (Security Awareness)</b>
- Trains people to avoid falling for scams or mistakes that lead to security breaches.
- Examples: Phishing awareness training, strong password policies, social engineering protection.

Example: Employees receive training to recognize phishing emails and avoid clicking suspicious links.

### Explaining Defense in Depth with an Example {#Explaining-Defense-in-Depth-with-an-Example}

Imagine a company's network that stores sensitive customer information. Here’s how Defense in Depth protects it:

1. <b>Physical Security:</b> The server room is locked, and only authorized personnel can enter.
2. <b>Network Security:</b> Firewalls block attackers from accessing the company’s internal network.
3. <b>Endpoint Security:</b> Employees use antivirus software and VPNs on their laptops.
4. <b>Application Security:</b> The company's login system uses Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized access.
5. <b>Data Security:</b> All customer data is encrypted, so even if stolen, it’s unreadable.
6. <b>Human Layer:</b> Employees receive cybersecurity training to recognize phishing attacks.

Even if one layer is breached, the others help stop or slow down the attack.

## What is Zero Trust and Trust but Verify {#What-is-Zero-Trust-and-Trust-but-Verify}

In cybersecurity, the way we decide who gets access to data and systems is critical. Two major approaches are:

- Trust but Verify – The traditional security model. Users inside the network are trusted, but their actions may be monitored.
- Zero Trust – The modern security model. No one is trusted by default, and every request must be verified.

### Trust but Verify {#Trust-but-Verify}
- **How it works**
    - Users inside the network are trusted automatically.
    - Security checks are performed only after trust is given.
    - Assumes that internal users (employees, partners) are safe.
- **Problems:**
    - **Insider threats** – If an employee account is hacked, the attacker can move freely.
    - **Network breaches** – If an attacker gets past the firewall, they can access critical data.

**Example:** 
A company allows all employees to access internal servers once they log in. If an attacker steals an employee’s credentials, they can access everything inside without additional security checks.

### Zero Trust {#Zero-Trust}
- **How it works**
    - Never trust, always verify – Every request must be authenticated, no matter where it comes from.
    - Uses Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), encryption, and least privilege access.
    - Assumes anyone can be a threat, even inside the network.
- **Problems:**
    - Prevents unauthorized access by requiring verification for every action.
    - Limits damage if an account is hacked by restricting access.
    - Works better for remote work and cloud environments.

**Example:** 
A company using Zero Trust requires employees to verify their identity every time they access a sensitive file. Even if an attacker steals a password, they still need an MFA code to proceed.

## Threat vs Risk {#Threat-vs-Risk}
In cybersecurity, threats and risks are often confused, but they mean different things:
- A **threat** is something that can cause harm (like a hacker, malware, or a phishing attack).
- A **risk** is the chance of harm happening (how likely the threat is to cause damage).

Simply put:
- **Threat = Danger** ((e.g., hackers, malware))
- **Risk = Chance of being affected** (e.g., weak passwords increase the risk of hacking)

### Threats {#Threats}
A threat isas anything that can exploit a weakness and cause harm to an organization.

**Examples of Threats**
- **Cybercriminals** trying to hack into your network
- **Malware** that infects your system
- **Phishing emails** that trick users into giving away passwords
- **Insider threats** (employees stealing data)
- **Natural disasters** (floods, fires damaging data centers)

**Example:**
A hacker launching a ransomware attack is a threat because they can encrypt files and demand payment.

### Risk {#Risk}
A risk is the likelihood that a threat will actually cause damage. It depends on vulnerabilities and security measures.

**Examples of Risks**
- Using weak passwords → Higher risk of account hacking
- No firewall or antivirus → Higher risk of malware infection
- Employees clicking on phishing emails → Higher risk of data breaches
- No data backups → Higher risk of permanent data loss

**Example:**
If a company doesn’t have strong security, the risk of a ransomware attack increases because attackers can easily access the system.

## Conclusion {#Conclusion}
Cybersecurity is about protecting systems and data from threats while managing risks. The **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and the **DAD Triad** (Disclosure, Alteration, Denial) are core principles that guide security efforts. **Defense in Depth** advocates for layered protection, while **Zero Trust** challenges the old belief that internal users are automatically trusted. **Threats** are potential dangers like hackers or malware, while **risk** refers to the likelihood of these threats causing harm. Understanding these concepts helps organizations make informed decisions to secure their systems, reduce vulnerabilities, and keep their data safe.
